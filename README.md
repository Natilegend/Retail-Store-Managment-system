# Retail Store Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
This is a CLI-based Java application for managing a retail store's inventory. It allows users to manage products and categories, with data persisted in a SQLite database and activities logged to a text file.

## Unresolved Problems
The "src" folder is treated as a package in our project setup. Although we attempted to resolve this, we were unable to do so, so we adjusted our code to work with this structure. This does not affect the functionality of the program.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Java 21 is installed.
2. Place the SQLite JDBC driver JAR in the `lib` folder.
3. Compile the source code 
4. Run the application
